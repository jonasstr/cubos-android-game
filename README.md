# Cubos Android Game

## About
I developed this game as a way to learn about Unity3D game development.  
This project is not in active development. Feel free to modify it in any way you like, see [License](https://github.com/jonasstr/cubos-android-game/blob/master/LICENSE).  
Tested with Unity version 5.6.1f1. Requires the [Unity remote app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unity3d.genericremote&hl=de) to run inside Unity.

## Download
